          question:"How to become a Frontend Developer?" ,
          answer: `Start with learning HTML and CSS; don't wait to fully master these and start building simple projects as soon as possible. You could try rebuilding the frontend of your favorite websites using HTML and CSS to start with. Do as many of these projects as possible as you keep learning. Once you are somewhat comfortable with HTML and CSS, start learning some basic JavaScript (DOM manipulation, making AJAX calls etc) and learn how to add interactivity to your websites. While you are at it learn some basics of Git and GitHub. At this point you should be able to get an entry level frontend development job. Keep revisiting this roadmap and try to fill the gaps in your knowledge.`,

        question: `How to become a Backend Developer?`,
        answer: `If you are a complete beginner who is just getting started, you can start by learning a backend programming language such as Python, Ruby, Java, Go etc. Once you have got the basic to intermediate understanding of the language, learn about the package manager for that language and learn how to install and use external packages into your applications. Learn the basics of some relational database e.g. PostgreSQL and learn how to run simple CRUD operations. Optionally, you can pick up and learn a web framework for the language of your choice as well. Learn how to build a simple RESTful API and implement simple Authentication/Authorization into it. While you are learning all the items mentioned above, don't forget to learn about Git and GitHub as well.

After following all the instructions above, you can start applying for the entry level backend developer jobs. Also, look at the backend developer roadmap above to get an idea about the landscape and see what else you are missing. A degree in computer science or related field is not always necessary but networking, building a portfolio and actively seeking internships, junior developer positions or consulting can help to start and advance a career as a backend developer.

Note: remember to make a lot of projects while you are learning to solidify your understanding of the concepts. Also, it's important to have the attitude of continuous learning to improve your skills and be prepared for the fast-paced technology evolution in the industry.`,

        questions:[
        {
          question: `How do Agile and DevOps interrelate?`,
          answer: `Agile and DevOps both prioritize collaboration, continuous improvement, and delivering working software. They can be used together to create a more efficient software development process. Agile emphasizes iterative development and customer satisfaction, while DevOps emphasizes automating processes and integrating development and operations teams. When used together, Agile and DevOps can improve software development and delivery by streamlining processes and enhancing collaboration.`,

        {
          question: `What are some misconceptions about DevOps?`,
          answer: `Some common misconceptions about DevOps include:

DevOps is just automation: While automation is an important part of DevOps, it's not the only thing. DevOps is a culture that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams to improve the quality and speed of software delivery.

DevOps is just a job title: DevOps is a mindset and set of practices, not a specific job title. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps practices in their work, including developers, testers, operations engineers, and others.

DevOps eliminates the need for IT operations: DevOps does not eliminate the need for IT operations. Instead, it changes the way that operations teams work by promoting collaboration with development teams and introducing new tools and processes for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.`,
